# Scripts
Scripts that I made, mostly because school made me do it, but sometimes just because I wanted to




Definitions of my arbitrary classifications:

Low effort scripts - Less than a hour to make
Low-Mid effort scripts - 1 to 2 hours to make
Mid effort scripts - 2 to 5 hours to make
Mid-Fair effort scripts - 5 to 7 hours to make
Fair effort scripts - 7 to 12 hours to make
High effort scripts - 12 to 100 hours to make
Ridiculously high effort scripts - 100+ hours (I dont know if there even is a script that can take that long to be made but I guess I will find out)
